                <p>I just moved to Vyrodin from a small town and I'm living in Free District. I want to try authentic local food but I don't know where to start.</p>
                
                <p>What are your recommendations? Bonus points for cheap eats since I'm on a tight budget.</p>
                
                <p>I've seen a lot of food trucks around but I don't know which ones are good and which ones will give me mana poisoning lol</p>

                <p>Welcome to the city! Free District has the BEST street food, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.</p>
                
                <p>My top picks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Portobello Guys</strong> - Amazing mushroom-based food truck. Everything they make is incredible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mana Noodles</strong> - Best ramen in the district, open late</li>
                    <li><strong>Crystal Kebabs</strong> - Not actual crystals lol, just really good meat skewers</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Avoid the place near the old factory. You'll know it when you see it.</p>

                <p>PORTOBELLO GUYS. Seriously. Their food truck is usually parked near the market square.</p>
                
                <p>Get the Mushroom Steak. It tastes EXACTLY like real beef but it's all mushrooms. I don't know how they do it but it's amazing.</p>
                
                <p>Also their Mushroom Cream Soup is perfect on cold days.</p>

                <p>Another vote for Portobello Guys. Their Mushroom and Chicken Shawarma is incredible. Perfect blend of flavors.</p>
                
                <p>They also do a Mushroom Risotto that's creamy and rich. Costs like 8 marks and it's a full meal.</p>

                <p>If you're on a budget, Portobello Guys is your best bet. Huge portions, cheap prices, and actually tastes good.</p>
                
                <p>I lived off their Mushroom Carbonara for like two months when I was broke. 6 marks for a massive serving.</p>

                <p>Okay everyone is saying Portobello Guys so I'm definitely trying them tomorrow. The Mushroom Steak sounds amazing.</p>
                
                <p>Where exactly is the market square? I'm still learning my way around.</p>

                <p>Market square is in the center of Free District. If you're coming from the M.A.W. station, head east for about 10 minutes. You'll see a bunch of vendors and food trucks.</p>
                
                <p>Portobello Guys has a green and purple truck. Can't miss it.</p>

                <p>I'm gonna be honest, I was skeptical about mushroom-based food but Portobello Guys converted me.</p>
                
                <p>The Mushroom Steak is legitimately better than most actual steaks I've had. And I'm not even vegetarian.</p>
                
                <p>Also try their mushroom tea if they have it. Sounds weird but it's really good.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Granny's Dumplings</strong> - Old lady makes the best dumplings, usually near the fountain</li>
                    <li><strong>Spicy Scroll</strong> - Tekk-style spicy food, not for the faint of heart</li>

                <p>Been eating Free District street food for 40 years. Portobello Guys is the real deal.</p>
                
                <p>Fun fact: The owner is a drow who was raised by a chef in Free District. That chef taught them everything - traditional Drow cooking methods combined with local techniques.</p>
                
                <p>The chef passed away a few years back, but their legacy lives on. The owner wanted to make good food accessible to everyone, just like their mentor did.</p>
                
                <p>That's why their prices are so low despite the quality being restaurant-level.</p>

                <p>@OldTimer_89 I didn't know that! That explains why everything tastes so good.</p>
                
                <p>I've been going there for years and the owner is nice too. Always remember regular customers.</p>
