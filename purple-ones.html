                <h3>THE PURPLE ONES ARE REAL AND THEY'RE TAKING PEOPLE</h3>
                
                <p>I'm not crazy. I know how this sounds but PLEASE hear me out.</p>
                
                <p>My neighbor, Kelvin, disappeared last week. Just... gone. No note, no warning, nothing. The City Guard said he probably moved to another district. But I KNOW what I saw.</p>
                
                <p><strong>WHAT I SAW:</strong></p>
                
                <p>It was 2 AM on the 8th of Harvest. I couldn't sleep so I was looking out my window (I live in Free District, third floor). I saw THREE figures in the alley behind our building. They were wearing PURPLE ROBES. Not like Church robes - these were different. Darker. And they GLOWED faintly.</p>
                
                <p>Their eyes... gods, their eyes. They glowed this sickly yellow-green color. Not like mana light. Something else.</p>
                
                <p>They were standing around Kelvin. He looked... frozen? Like he couldn't move. One of them touched his forehead and he just went limp. They carried him into the shadows and VANISHED. Not teleported - I know what teleportation looks like. They just... faded into nothing.</p>
                
                <p><strong>THE PATTERN:</strong></p>
                
                <p>I started asking around. Turns out Kelvin isn't the first. In the last SIX MONTHS, at least 23 people have disappeared from Free District alone. The Church says they're runaways or criminals fleeing justice. But I found a pattern:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>All disappearances happen between 1-4 AM</li>
                    <li>All victims live in outer districts (Free, Grezer's Path, Outer Sprawl)</li>
                    <li>Multiple witnesses report "purple figures" before disappearances</li>
                    <li>NO BODIES EVER FOUND</li>
                    <li>Church refuses to investigate properly</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>WHO ARE THEY?</strong></p>
                
                <p>I've been researching. There are old stories from before the Union about "The Purple Ones" - some kind of cult or secret society. They supposedly experimented on people during the Civil War. Testing magic, trying to create super-soldiers, that kind of thing.</p>
                
                <p>The official story is they were wiped out when the Union was founded. But what if they weren't? What if they went underground? The Undercity is HUGE. There are sections nobody has mapped. What if they're down there?</p>
                
                <p><strong>THE CHURCH KNOWS:</strong></p>
                
                <p>I tried to file a report with the Church Guard. The officer LAUGHED at me. Said I was seeing things. But when I mentioned the purple robes, his face changed. He got serious real quick and told me to "stop spreading rumors" or I'd be "detained for public disturbance."</p>
                
                <p>THEY KNOW. They're covering it up. Why? Are they working with the Purple Ones? Are they afraid of them? What's going on?</p>
                
                <p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS TO THE VICTIMS?</strong></p>
                
                <p>This is the part that keeps me up at night. WHERE are they taking people? WHAT are they doing to them? Are they still alive?</p>
                
                <p>I found one person who claims they ESCAPED. They wouldn't give me their name but they told me they were taken to "a place beneath the city" where "they do things to your mana." They said there were dozens of people there, all in cages, all being "tested."</p>
                
                <p>They managed to escape during some kind of accident but they're too scared to go to the authorities. They said the Purple Ones have people EVERYWHERE. Even in the Church.</p>
                
                <p><strong>WHAT CAN WE DO?</strong></p>
                
                <p>I'm posting this because people need to KNOW. If you live in an outer district, be careful at night. Lock your doors. Ward your windows. Travel in groups.</p>
                
                <p>If you've seen the Purple Ones or know someone who disappeared, PLEASE comment below. We need to document this. We need PROOF they can't ignore.</p>
                
                <p>The Church won't protect us. We have to protect ourselves.</p>
                
                <p>THEY ARE REAL. THEY ARE TAKING PEOPLE. AND NOBODY IS DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT.</p>
                
                <p>Stay safe out there.</p>

                <p>This is ridiculous. The Church investigates every missing person report. If people are "disappearing" it's because they're criminals fleeing justice or they moved without telling anyone. Stop spreading panic.</p>

                <p>I've been exploring the Undercity for years. There ARE sections that don't appear on any maps. Deep sections. And I've found... things. Symbols on the walls. Purple symbols. Old lab equipment. Cages.</p>

                <p>I looked into the "Purple Ones" legend. There ARE historical references. During the Civil War, both factions had secret research programs. One Magus program was called "Project Violet" - they were trying to enhance soldiers with experimental mana infusions.</p>
                
                <p>The project was supposedly shut down in 1928 A.U. after "ethical violations." But the records are sealed. What were they doing? And what happened to the researchers?</p>
